# yFiles for HTML Downloader Dummy Module

This module helps you download [yFiles for HTML](https://yworks.com/yfileshtml?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=redirect). 
It does __not__ contain the library or sources necessary to work with
yFiles for HTML. You probably don't need this module. It exists to prevent users of the yFiles for HTML package from
accidentally or purposefully publishing yFiles for HTML publicly on NPM. The yFiles software does come as an NPM module and may
be published in private npm repositories, but it may not be published publicly without prior written consent of yWorks GmbH.

Note that this dummy module _is_ under a permissive license, whereas yFiles for HTML _is not_ and thus cannot be redistributed via public registries.
